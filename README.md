This repository demonstrates a potential data race in Rust when modifying a vector using unsafe code. The `bug.rs` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a safe and correct alternative using appropriate synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or atomic operations. The unsafe code directly manipulates the vector's memory using `as_mut_ptr()`, ignoring Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.  Concurrent access to this memory without synchronization leads to data corruption and unexpected behavior. The solution emphasizes safe and efficient concurrency using synchronization primitives built into the Rust standard library.
